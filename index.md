title: "Becoming part of the open source community"
---

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about learning how to use GitHub to contribute to projects, upload my own projects and become a part of the open source community. 

From what I can see, there are a plethora of projects to explore and look forward to finding some interesting projects that I can interact with and hopefully contribute in some way.
